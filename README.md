# Lab 1204 - Digital Circuits Design
## Department of Information and Electronic Engineering (IEE) - International Hellenic University (IHU)
In this repository you can find supplementary material related to this hands-on lesson. All mandatory exercises for the lab can be found on [Moodle](https://moodle.teithe.gr/course/view.php?id=4142). General information about the lesson can be found on its [official page](https://www.iee.ihu.gr/course/%CF%83%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%B4%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%88%CE%B7%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%8E%CE%BD-%CF%83%CF%85%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BC%CE%AC%CF%84%CF%89%CE%BD/)


## Online Circuit Design Software
You can prepare for the lab session without any electronic components and equipment using [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits), a free online tool provided by [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/). You can create and simulate basic circuits, making measurements with the virtual multimeter.

[Check out this example](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2nxMoS8u7Zj-copy-of-lab2-not/editel?tenant=circuits?sharecode=fQDNPCRLdsfmbmRB4XNHljJGESkk2KYz8k3_-yrK1gI=) from Tutorial 1, that simulates the circuit with a single led and a dip switch.
